Title -
AN IMPROVED SALP SWARM ALGORITHM BASED ON ADAPTIVE ß-HILL CLIMBING FOR STOCK MARKET PREDICTION

Description of the project - 
- Using swarm-based optimizers with a local search algorithm to predict the stock price based on historical data.
- Implementing Swarm based optimization (E.g. - Salp Swarm, Particle Swarm, Butterfly optimization, etc.) to analyze the accuracy of different algorithms.
- Improve the accuracy of Salp Swarm optimizer using Adaptive ß-Hill climbing, a local search technique.

- LSSVR - Least Square Support Vector Machine algorithm was used to build a model for stock market prediction based on historical stock price fluctuations.
- A custom optimizer (Salp Swarm Optimizer) was used to optimize the cost function. 
- An attempt was made to observe how the accuracy of the prediction varies by varying the optimizing module of the model.
